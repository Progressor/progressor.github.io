        Progressor is an open-source project for programming teachers. It allows them to create programming exercises which students can solve online, letting them check their solution directly from their browser in a wide variety of languages.

        Motivation
      </div>

      <h4>A Lot Of Practice</h4>
      <p>
        When learning to program for the first time, practice is of first importance. Learning the basics of a programming language and its paradigm requires some theory and a lot of practice.
      </p>

      <h4>As Little Obstacles As Possible</h4>
      <p>
        All around the world, many students start their studies before acquiring fluency in English, the <em>de facto</em> language of Computer Science and programming. This should not be an obstacle to learning basic programming skills in the early days of their studies.
        <br>
        This is why Progressor comes with a bunch of languages: Arabic, German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese, â€¦
      </p>

      <p>
        The most important thing for students is to be able to train without the sometimes huge overhead of installing a bunch of tools, opening many exercise files, writing their solutions, executing test cases, going back to the code, etc.
        <br>
        Progressor abstracts all these painful details, allowing students to work directly from their web browser, focusing on what matters first: becoming familiar with loops, working with lists, understanding functions, etc.
